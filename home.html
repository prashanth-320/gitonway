     Ram Gopal Varma was born to Krishnam Raju Penmetsa and Suryamma, 
     in Hyderabad. During his childhood, Varma bunked school regularly and 
     go watch movies. Being highly irregular at school, he was under constant 
     scrutiny and this hampered his relationship with his family. For most of 
     his childhood, he grew up as a loner and was obsessed with movies. He would
     repeatedly watch certain scenes of a movie just because he liked them.
     According to RGV, this childhood habit eventually helped him in directing movies later
     in his life.

     <p> 
     Varma attended the V.R. Siddhartha Engineering College and holds a degree in Civil
    Engineering. After his graduation, he worked as a site engineer for the Krishna Oberoi
    Hotel located in Hyderabad. It was during his stay in Hyderabad that he happened to visit
    a video rental library in Hyderabad, which inspired him to start his own video rental
    library in Hyderabad. Dedicated to making his dreams come true, RGV soon started to develop
    contacts with the film fraternity.
    </p>
      

   <p>RGV was the first guy in India to use the Steady-Cam, which is a Camera that can be used
      to take focussed images even while moving. RGV was the guy who dared to break Indian Cinema's 
      Song and Dance routine.
